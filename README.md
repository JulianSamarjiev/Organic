# Organic

## An open source experiment

### http://juliansamarjiev.github.io/Organic/

This project is meant to be an open canvas for collaboration, contribute any content, functionality, design to the project. Let's see where this takes us and how it evolves!

#### Guidelines:

1. Please add your username/name and contribution description (content addition, design change, library added, functionality added etc.) to the README
2. Add functionality, or design iterations, instead of meme's and/or pointless content etc.
3. No offensive content
